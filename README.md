# Tweleve days of christmas function

## Basic functions

Given the issue of recieving multiple gifts from the tweleve days of christmas - I wanted to calulate the total number of presents recieved.  Also to calaculate the total number of presents recieved on a specific day.

I started off with a loop function.

Then looked at mathmatical formula method

Then used the most elegant solution that used the cumsum function.

## Additional functions

We then added some validation to our function 

There was an additional ask to see if was possible to calculate the total number of presents across a longer period.  I used 2 years as an example.

Furthermore, we also wanted to add the assumption that partridge in a pear tree counted as 2 presents and work out how to account for that.

## Dependancies

All code is base R apart from use of English function to convert numbers to words
